# PDB - social network database application

## How to run application
- start docker with databases
- run init scripts for both MariaDB and Cassandra
- run project in IDE (green play button) - it should work by itself...
- have fun

## TODO list
- [x] setup relational database (RDB)
- [x] create tables in RDB
- [ ] indexes in RDB?
- [ ] create sample data for RDB
- [x] create tables in Cassandra
- [x] setup demo application
- [ ] consider adding Name (and Surname) as primary keys in case of searching ? or somehow solve searching by name ?
- [ ] profile URL translation to email for searching ?
